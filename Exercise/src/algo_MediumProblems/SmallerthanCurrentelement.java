/*
 * 1) Did i understand the problem? 
 *    Parameters
 *      -> What is the input for this problem? array
 *      -> What will be the output for this problem? int
 *      -> is there any constraints? 
 *         
 * 2) Test data set -yes
 *    -> Minimum of 3 data sets
 *    -> Positive, Negative and Edge case scenario
 *    -> Validate the test data with interviewer
 *    
 * 3) Do i know to solve it? - yes broute force
 * 
 * 4) Ask for hint if don't know to solve? 
 * 
 * 5) Do i know any alternate solution? 
 *    -> No, Solve with the known solution
 *    
 * 6) If alternate solution found -> Find the O notation 
 *     -> Explain either or the best one depends on time
 *     -> Approach 01 : Starts with worst(Brute force)
 *     -> Approach 02: Write the options and benefits of it 
 *     -> Always start from worst to best
 *     
 * 7) Proceed with pseudocode 
 * 
 * 8) Implement code in editor
 * 
 * 9) Test against data set
 * 
 * 10) Debug if it fails
